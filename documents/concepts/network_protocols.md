# Protocol Explanations

| Protocol | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Ethernet** | Local area network technology that defines cabling and data transmission on the physical and data link layers. |
| **IP** (Internet Protocol) | The main network layer protocol responsible for addressing and routing data packets. |
| **ICMP** (Internet Control Message Protocol) | A protocol for sending error messages and operational information, used by the ping utility. |
| **IGMP** (Internet Group Management Protocol) | A protocol for managing membership in multicast groups. |
| **ARP** (Address Resolution Protocol) | A protocol for resolving an IP address to a MAC address. |
| **RARP** (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) | An obsolete protocol for resolving a MAC address to an IP address. |
| **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) | A transport layer protocol that provides reliable, connection-oriented data transmission. |
| **UDP** (User Datagram Protocol) | A transport layer protocol that provides fast, connectionless data transmission without delivery guarantees. |
| **SSH** (Secure Shell) | A protocol for secure remote access to a command line and command execution. |
| **SMTP** (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) | A protocol for sending email. |
| **HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) | A protocol for transferring hypertext, the foundation of the World Wide Web. |
| **POP3** (Post Office Protocol version 3) | A protocol for retrieving email from a server. |
| **DNS** (Domain Name System) | A system for translating domain names into IP addresses. |
| **NTP** (Network Time Protocol) | A protocol for synchronizing computer clocks over a network. |
| **DHCP** (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) / **BOOTP** (Bootstrap Protocol) | Protocols for automatically assigning IP addresses and other network parameters to devices on a network. |
